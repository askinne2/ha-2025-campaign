## ðŸš€ Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Deploy from Root Directory (Recommended)

#### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
2. Click the **+** icon â†’ **New repository**
3. Repository name: `ha-2025-campaign` (or your preferred name)
4. Description: "Hispanic Alliance 15th Anniversary Campaign Planning Resources"
5. Choose **Public** (for GitHub Pages to work with free account)
6. **Do NOT** initialize with README (we have one already)
7. Click **Create repository**

#### Step 2: Push Files to GitHub

```bash
# Navigate to your project folder
cd "/Users/andrewskinner/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Creative Cloud Files/0-HA-CC/2025/4 - 2025 EOY/2025 HA EOY Overview"

# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all campaign site files
git add index.html
git add campaign-strategy.html
git add campaign-calendar.html
git add assets/
git add README.md
git add .gitignore
git add DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md

# Commit files
git commit -m "Initial commit: HA 15th Anniversary Campaign site"

# Add remote repository (replace with your actual repository URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/ha-2025-campaign.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

#### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** (gear icon)
3. Scroll down to **Pages** in the left sidebar
4. Under **Source**, select:
   - Branch: `main`
   - Folder: `/ (root)`
5. Click **Save**
6. Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment

#### Step 4: Access Your Site

Your site will be available at:
```
https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/ha-2025-campaign/
```

---

### Option 2: Deploy from /docs Directory

If you prefer to keep the site in a `/docs` folder:

#### Step 1: Organize Files

```bash
# Create docs directory
mkdir docs

# Move site files to docs
mv index.html docs/
mv campaign-strategy.html docs/
mv campaign-calendar.html docs/
mv assets docs/

# Keep README.md in root
# Keep .gitignore in root
```

#### Step 2: Update Links (if needed)

All links in the HTML files use relative paths, so they'll work fine in `/docs`.

#### Step 3: Push to GitHub

```bash
git init
git add docs/
git add README.md
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Initial commit: HA campaign site in /docs"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/ha-2025-campaign.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

#### Step 4: Configure GitHub Pages

1. Go to Settings â†’ Pages
2. Select:
   - Branch: `main`
   - Folder: `/docs`
3. Click **Save**

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Links Not Working

**Problem:** Navigation links show 404 errors

**Solution:** 
- Verify all files are in the same directory structure
- Check that file names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Make sure you're using relative paths (no `/` at the beginning)

### CSS Not Loading

**Problem:** Pages appear unstyled

**Solution:**
- Verify `assets/css/styles.css` exists
- Check that the path in HTML files is: `href="assets/css/styles.css"`
- Clear browser cache and hard reload (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Site Not Deploying

**Problem:** GitHub Pages shows error or site doesn't appear

**Solution:**
- Wait 2-5 minutes (deployment can take time)
- Check Actions tab for build errors
- Verify repository is Public
- Make sure you selected the correct branch and folder
