# Hispanic Alliance - 2025 Year-End Campaign Resources

## Overview

Campaign planning materials for Hispanic Alliance's 15th Anniversary "Sprint to December 13" year-end campaign. This mini-site provides comprehensive strategy documentation and visual calendars for the organization's Quinceañera campaign.

## 🎯 Campaign Concept

**"From Circle to Table – 15 Years of Building Together"**

This strategic campaign positions Homes for the Holiday (December 13) as the campaign finish line—not December 31. This approach delivers:

- ✅ Better donor experience (less rushed, more thoughtful giving)
- ✅ Improved staff well-being (normal holidays, sustainable execution)
- ✅ Attainable revenue goal ($50K projected)
- ✅ Enhanced event impact (celebration, not mid-campaign touchpoint)
